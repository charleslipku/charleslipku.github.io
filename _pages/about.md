I am currently a Research Associate in Qualcomm AI Research. Before joining Qualcomm, I obtained Ph.D. from Duke University under the supervision of Professor [Yiran Chen](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/yiran-chen) and [Hai “Helen” Li](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/hai-helen-li) in [Duke CEI Lab](http://cei.pratt.duke.edu/). <span style="color:blue"> I will join the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Maryland, College Park as a tenure-track assistant professor.</span> My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and edge computing, with a focus on building large-scale networked and trustworthy intelligent systems to solve practical problems in a collaborative, scalable, secure, and ubiquitous manner. 

**Openings**: I'm looking for highly motivated Ph.D. and master students, and research interns to join my group. If you are interested, please send an email to [angliece@umd.edu](mailto:angliece@umd.edu) with you CV and transcripts attached.
