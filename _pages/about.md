I am currently a Research Associate in Qualcomm AI Research. Before joining Qualcomm, I obtained Ph.D. from Duke University under the supervision of Professor [Yiran Chen](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/yiran-chen) and [Hai “Helen” Li](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/hai-helen-li) in [Duke CEI Lab](http://cei.pratt.duke.edu/). <span style="color:red"> I will join the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Maryland, College Park as a tenure-track assistant professor.</span> My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and edge computing, with a focus on building large-scale networked and trustworthy intelligent systems to solve practical problems in a collaborative, scalable, secure, and ubiquitous manner. 

**Openings**: I'm looking for highly motivated Ph.D. and master students, and research interns to join my group. If you are interested, please send an email to [angliece@umd.edu](mailto:angliece@umd.edu) with you CV and transcripts attached.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
